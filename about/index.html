        <p>The first generic gun game was created on 2/3/2022, it was worked on for a while before being succeeded by generic gun game 2. both of these games are still up but no longer receiving updates and have been abandoned. the third game was created on 8/20/2024 and is currently being worked on by Luk, Zeus_gameover and d3wys.
        GGG3 has a wide range of weapons but this game isnt only about guns, its about having fun and exploring the large map layed out for the user. For the future of GGG3 we can expect more features and game mechanics, more guns, and map expansons. the development team has no itention of adding pay to win mechanics in the future.
